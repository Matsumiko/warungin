# Agent Variants

Reference links should be reviewed before major releases because agent tooling changes frequently.

## Current assessment

The current kit is strong on discipline, verification, and project DNA.

The gaps are mostly structural:

- the README promises support for several agents, but the repo only ships one full generic kit
- some tools now prefer native filenames and scoped rule files
- the always-on instruction surface is larger than it needs to be

## Recommended architecture

Use a hub-and-spoke model:

1. Keep the root kit as the canonical policy pack.
2. Add thin native adapters for each agent.
3. Keep always-on files short.
4. Push deep context into the project docs instead of duplicating it everywhere.
5. Let all adapters defer to `SESSION.md` for resumable session checkpoints.

| Tool           | Preferred native format                                                         | Notes                                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenAI Codex   | `AGENTS.md` and optional `AGENTS.override.md`                                   | Supports layered discovery from global scope to current directory.         |
| Claude Code    | `CLAUDE.md` plus `.claude/settings.json`                                        | Keep behavior in the markdown file and config/permissions in settings.     |
| Cursor         | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`                                                           | `.cursorrules` is legacy.                                                  |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` plus `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` | Repo-wide and path-specific instructions are both first-class.             |
| Gemini CLI     | `GEMINI.md`                                                                     | Hierarchical context files are supported, and filenames can be customized. |
| Windsurf       | `.windsurf/rules/*.md`                                                          | Rule files can be scoped and triggered.                                    |
| Cline          | `.clinerules/*.md`                                                              | Simple markdown rules, compatible with cross-tool content.                 |
| Aider          | `CONVENTIONS.md` loaded via `.aider.conf.yml` or `--read`                       | Aider works best with an explicit conventions file.                        |
